# 🎬 Netflix Movies & The Office Analysis  🚀

In this project, I apply my **Python programming skills** to solve real-world data science problems. Using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and other Python tools, I investigate two key questions:  
1. **Are Netflix movies getting shorter over time?** 🕒  
2. **Which guest stars appeared in the most popular episode of *The Office*?** 🌟
